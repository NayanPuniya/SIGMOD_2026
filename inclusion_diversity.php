    <p class="mb-4">
      The Data Management community is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">ACM policy against harassment</a>. Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this yearâ€™s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.

      Please follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Inclusion and Diversity in Writing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Inclusion</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li class="mb-2">
        <strong>Implicit assumption:</strong> An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-2">
        <strong>Oppressive terminology:</strong> Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">this article</a>.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-2">
        <strong>Marginalization of URGs:</strong> An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-2">
        <strong>Lack of accessibility:</strong> Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind.
      </li>
    </ul>
