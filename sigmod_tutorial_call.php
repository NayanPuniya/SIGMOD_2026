    <p class="mb-6">
      We invite proposals for tutorials to be presented at the 2025 ACM SIGMOD conference on topics of interest to the database community. This includes the latest developments in data management, data science & engineering, interdisciplinary topics, and foundational introductions to related areas.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Tutorial Formats</h3>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Tutorials can be categorized into the following formats:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Survey:</strong> In-depth survey of the chosen topic with detailed descriptions of specific works.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Hands-on Tutorials (Lecture Style):</strong> In-depth hands-on training on cutting-edge systems and tools relevant to data management and data science.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Primer:</strong> A fundamental introduction to an area less familiar to the database community that has potential impact on database research or could benefit from database support.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      A meaningful summary of open research issues on the topic should be included in all cases. Each accepted tutorial is expected to jump-start non-experts, equipping them with the crucial knowledge required to commence research on the topic.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Tutorial proposals should be no more than six pages, plus an unlimited number of pages for citations, in the same format as research papers. Proposals should be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:SigmodTutorials@gmail.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">SigmodTutorials@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Each submission should include the following information:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li class="mb-2">The proposed tutorial title.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">The preferred duration (1.5 or 3 hours). If both options are possible, the proposal should identify which material will be included for each length.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">An abstract.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">Sufficient detail to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">A comprehensive bibliography for the proposed tutorial.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">A short description of the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge for attendees.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">A very brief biography of the proposed presenter(s), along with contact information.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">If (part of) the tutorial material or an earlier version of it has been or will be presented elsewhere before SIGMOD 2025, the proposal should indicate those events (and dates), and describe how the current proposal differs from the previous editions.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">For Hands-on tutorials: a list of hardware/software requirements and instructions for attendees.</li>
    </ul>
