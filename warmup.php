    <p class="mb-6">
      In 2025, SIGMOD/PODS will continue the <strong>Warm-Up Day</strong> initiative. The goal is to provide an opportunity for authors of accepted papers to present their work ahead of the conference, engage with the community, and receive early feedback.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The Warm-Up Day will be held <strong>virtually</strong> before the main conference dates. It is intended to increase accessibility and exposure of the presented work, especially for those unable to travel or attend in person.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Details about how to participate, schedules, and streaming links will be posted on this page as they become available. Please stay tuned!
    </p>
